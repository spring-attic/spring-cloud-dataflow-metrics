Spring Cloud Data Flow Metrics provides the foundation to help export Boot metrics that are exposed under the 
`/metrics` endpoint to a variety of external systems.  It provides Spring Boot AutoConfiguration to setup 
the exporting process and common functionality such as defining a prefix for your metric names.

The `spring-cloud-dataflow-metrics-log` module provides a `LogMetricWriter` that writes Boot metrics into 
the log file.  While it is a very simple `MetricWriter` implementation, log files
are often ingested into application monitoring tools where they can be further processed to create 
dashboards of an application's performance.  

Most important for Spring Cloud Data Flow Stream applications are the inclusion of 
http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/system-management-chapter.html#mgmt-channel-features[Spring Integration channel metrics] such as message rates.

== Maven configuration

== Configuration

The prefix that will be prepended to the names of metrics that are exposed under the `/metrics` endpoint can be configured using the property `spring.cloud.dataflow.metrics.prefix`.

The default value uses the form `${spring.cloud.application.group}.${spring.application.name}.<ID>` 
where `<ID>` and the `${}` placeholders are referencing standard Spring Boot Configuration properties.

If the `spring.cloud.application` placeholder values are not set, then the default value for 
`${spring.cloud.application.group}` is `group` and `${spring.application.name}` is `application`

The value of `<ID>` is resovled to one of the following placeholder expressions in the following order

* `${vcap.application.instance_index}`
* `${spring.application.index}`
* `${PID}`

Other useful property placeholder keys that you should be aware of when setting your own prefix value are

* `${server.port}`
* `${spring.cloud.client.ipAddress}`
* `${spring.cloud.client.hostname}`

The exporting process is controller though https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/metrics/export/MetricExportProperties.java[MetricExportProperties]. This lets you control how often the metrics are exported and which metrics to include/exclude.  Some documentation is available http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-metric-writers[here].

== Sister projects

The project https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-metrics-datadog[Spring Cloud Data Flow Metrics Datadog] exports metrics to Datadog.

== Sample application

https://github.com/markpollack/timemonitor[Timemonitor] is an example application (a WIP) that demonstrates creating the time source application from http://start-scs.cfapps.io/[Data Flow App Starters] and adding the ability to export metrics.

== Release Plans

Planning a 1.0 milestone release end of November.
